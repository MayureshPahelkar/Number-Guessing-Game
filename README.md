# Number-Guessing-Game

This project is a Number Guessing Game created using HTML, CSS, and PHP, where the system generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prompts the user to guess the number by entering a value within the given range. The user submits their guess through a simple and visually styled interface.

When the form is submitted, PHP processes the input and compares the user’s guessed number with the randomly generated number. If the guess is correct, a success message such as “Correct! You guessed it right” is displayed. If the guess is incorrect, the program displays a message indicating the guess was wrong along with the correct number, helping the user understand the outcome.

This project helps beginners practice random number generation, conditional statements, and form handling in PHP while also improving their frontend skills using CSS. It demonstrates how user input and backend logic work together to create an interactive web-based game.
